# rcalc
This project is a very experimental idea on performing calculus in a reverse way compared to the way we conventionnally do it. For addition, substraction and multiplication we operate from Left to Right while with division we go the other way. Both modes have their advanages and disadvantages. In this project we aim to show that for infinite precision calculus since numbers design goes from the highest digit to the lowest there is an inherent gain going from Right to Left. Research has show that we have an increase of computation steps. This project is in support of my PhD thesis on reproducible research. I investigates new ways of enforcing low level computation reliable.
